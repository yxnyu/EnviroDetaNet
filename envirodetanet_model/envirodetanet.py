'''Irreducible Representations(irreps) of vectorial and tensorial feature
    In DetaNet, vectors and tensors are represented by Irreducible Representations(irreps).
    More carefully, the irreps feature consists of features of different degrees l, order m, and parity p
    
    degree determines rotation equivariant of feature,Represented by the non-negative integers l=0,1,2,3,... 
     each degree have(2l+1) equivariant elements(rotation order), in the case of a vector, which has l=1 and has 2x1+1=3 
     elements, i.e. x,y,z. The scalar l=0, on the other hand, has only 1 element,are invariant.l=2 is a traceless tensor
     and can be combined with a scalar to form a 2nd-cartesian tensor.
     
    Parity is represented by the strings o or e, i.e. p=1 and p=-1,for odd and even parity respectively. parity of a
     tensor in physics is related to the degree: p=-1**(l). We have also adopted this strategy in our model.
     
    The irreps tensor can be considered as an independent subspace of the Cartesian tensor.
     Each Cartesian tensor can be represented by an irreps tensor. For example, a 2nd-order Cartesian tensor can 
    consist of a 2e irrep tensor(tressless tensor) and a 0e scalar(as tress),
     and a 3rd-order Cartesian tensor can consist of an 1o vector and an 3o irrep tensor.
     The higher order 4th, 5th order, and more Cartesian tensor can also be represented by the irreps tensor

        """Parameter introduction
    num_features:The dimension of the scalar feature and irreps feature(each order m), set to 128 by default.

    act: non-linear activation function,default is 'learnable swish'

    maxl:Maximum degree of the feature, default is 3. When the input is 3, the invariant (scalar) feature with l=0
    and the equivariant (vectorial, tensorial) feature with l=1,2,3 will be enabled

    num_block: the number of interaction layer(i.e. message passing layers), default is 3 layers.

    radial_type: Types of radial functions, we have 4 built-in radial functions,
    namely 'gaussian', 'bessel', 'exp_gaussian', and 'trainable_bessel'. After testing, 'trainable_bessel'
    works best and is therefore chosen as the default

    num_radial: the number of radial basis, set to 16 for small or MD datasets, 32 for large datasets.Default is 32.

    attention_head: Relates to the shape of the attention matrix in the attention mechanism and can have a small effect
    on training speed and accuracy. Must be set to a number that is divisible by num_features, default is 8.

    rc:cut-off radius,DetaNet constructs the local chemical environment of an atom within a radius,only inter-atomic
    distance smaller than the cut-off radius will be counted.
    The default is 5.0Å, which should be adjusted with training reference data.

    dropout: the proportion of features that will be dropped as they pass through the neural network,
    default is 0, i.e. no dropout. It is best not to dropout, especially on large data sets.

    use_cutoff:True or False uses the cutoff function, the default is false. If you use the bessel function, it contains
    the cutoff function itself, so it has almost no effect. If True, it will use the cosine cutoff function on the
    radial basis before entering the neural network.

    max_atomic_number: The maximum atomic number in the dataset, e.g. QM9 contains CHONF, the maximum is F:9,
    QM7-X contains CHONSCl, the maximum is Cl:17.The default is 9.

    atom_ref: the reference data for a single atom, is a tensor of the shape [n_atoms], which is needed when
    predicting energy, since energy can be considered as the sum of atomic energy and atomization energy.

    scale: the scale to multiply the output by, defaults to 1, i.e. no multiplication. Used for converting units etc.

    scalar_outsize: output size of scalars (invariants), default is 1, directly the size of scalar properties when
    predicting scalar properties, depending on the situation when predicting vector and tensor properties (see below).

    irrep_out: vector and tensor of the output, consisting of a non-negative integer and a string with the letters
    'o','e'. The number represents the degree, the letter 'o' stands for odd parity and the letter 'e' stands
    for even parity. e.g. a vector of degree 1 with odd parity is written as '1o', an untraceable tensor of degree 2
    with even parity is written as '2e', or if both need to be output, as '1o+2e'. Scalars written as '0e' are split
    in a separate scalar_outsize module and cannot be placed in that module, otherwise the values of the output
    scalars would both be 0. default is None,i.e. no vectors or tensors are output.

    summation: whether the atomic properties are summed to obtain the molecular properties. False if it is for atomic
    properties such as charge, fill in True for molecular properties. default is True.

    norm:When predicting vectors such as dipole moments, the sum of squares of the vectors is usually required.
    If this module is True, then the sum of squares of the result will be output. The default is False.

    out_type:The type of the output. We have 7 types of properties built into the model for the output function,
    the corresponding out_type are: scalar:scalar properties (e.g. energy).' dipole':dipole moment (electric dipole
    moment, magnetic dipole moment, transition dipole, etc.).' 2_tensor':2nd order tensor (e.g. Polarizability and
    quadrupole moments).' 3_tensor':3rd order tensor (e.g. first hyperpolarizablity).' R2':electronic spatial extent.
    'latent':direct output of scalar and tensor features after interacting layers. Other: direct output of
    scalar_outsize dimension and irrep tensor for irrep_out dimension. Default is 'scalar'

    grad_type:Type of derivative property, derivatives of 3 energies: 'force':atomic force, 'Hi':atomic part of Hessian
    matrix, 'Hij' interatomic part of Hessian matrix. For these 3 kinds, out_type must be 'scalar'.
    ' dipole','polar' are the derivatives of the dipole moment and polarizability respectively.
    For these 2 derivative properties, out_type must be 'dipole','2_tensor' respectively.

    device: device type, either torch.device('cuda') represents gpu or torch.device('cpu')  represents cpu

        """Parameter introduction
    num_features:The dimension of the scalar feature and irreps feature(each order m), set to 128 by default.

    act: non-linear activation function,default is 'learnable swish'

    maxl:Maximum degree of the feature, default is 3. When the input is 3, the invariant (scalar) feature with l=0
    and the equivariant (vectorial, tensorial) feature with l=1,2,3 will be enabled

    num_block: the number of interaction layer(i.e. message passing layers), default is 3 layers.

    radial_type: Types of radial functions, we have 4 built-in radial functions,
    namely 'gaussian', 'bessel', 'exp_gaussian', and 'trainable_bessel'. After testing, 'trainable_bessel'
    works best and is therefore chosen as the default

    num_radial: the number of radial basis, set to 16 for small or MD datasets, 32 for large datasets.Default is 32.

    attention_head: Relates to the shape of the attention matrix in the attention mechanism and can have a small effect
    on training speed and accuracy. Must be set to a number that is divisible by num_features, default is 8.

    rc:cut-off radius,DetaNet constructs the local chemical environment of an atom within a radius,only inter-atomic
    distance smaller than the cut-off radius will be counted.
    The default is 5.0Å, which should be adjusted with training reference data.

    dropout: the proportion of features that will be dropped as they pass through the neural network,
    default is 0, i.e. no dropout. It is best not to dropout, especially on large data sets.

    use_cutoff:True or False uses the cutoff function, the default is false. If you use the bessel function, it contains
    the cutoff function itself, so it has almost no effect. If True, it will use the cosine cutoff function on the
    radial basis before entering the neural network.

    max_atomic_number: The maximum atomic number in the dataset, e.g. QM9 contains CHONF, the maximum is F:9,
    QM7-X contains CHONSCl, the maximum is Cl:17.The default is 9.

    atom_ref: the reference data for a single atom, is a tensor of the shape [n_atoms], which is needed when
    predicting energy, since energy can be considered as the sum of atomic energy and atomization energy.

    scale: the scale to multiply the output by, defaults to 1, i.e. no multiplication. Used for converting units etc.

    scalar_outsize: output size of scalars (invariants), default is 1, directly the size of scalar properties when
    predicting scalar properties, depending on the situation when predicting vector and tensor properties (see below).

    irrep_out: vector and tensor of the output, consisting of a non-negative integer and a string with the letters
    'o','e'. The number represents the degree, the letter 'o' stands for odd parity and the letter 'e' stands
    for even parity. e.g. a vector of degree 1 with odd parity is written as '1o', an untraceable tensor of degree 2
    with even parity is written as '2e', or if both need to be output, as '1o+2e'. Scalars written as '0e' are split
    in a separate scalar_outsize module and cannot be placed in that module, otherwise the values of the output
    scalars would both be 0. default is None,i.e. no vectors or tensors are output.

    summation: whether the atomic properties are summed to obtain the molecular properties. False if it is for atomic
    properties such as charge, fill in True for molecular properties. default is True.

    norm:When predicting vectors such as dipole moments, the sum of squares of the vectors is usually required.
    If this module is True, then the sum of squares of the result will be output. The default is False.

    out_type:The type of the output. We have 7 types of properties built into the model for the output function,
    the corresponding out_type are: scalar:scalar properties (e.g. energy).' dipole':dipole moment (electric dipole
    moment, magnetic dipole moment, transition dipole, etc.).' 2_tensor':2nd order tensor (e.g. Polarizability and
    quadrupole moments).' 3_tensor':3rd order tensor (e.g. first hyperpolarizablity).' R2':electronic spatial extent.
    'latent':direct output of scalar and tensor features after interacting layers. Other: direct output of
    scalar_outsize dimension and irrep tensor for irrep_out dimension. Default is 'scalar'

    grad_type:Type of derivative property, derivatives of 3 energies: 'force':atomic force, 'Hi':atomic part of Hessian
    matrix, 'Hij' interatomic part of Hessian matrix. For these 3 kinds, out_type must be 'scalar'.
    ' dipole','polar' are the derivatives of the dipole moment and polarizability respectively.
    For these 2 derivative properties, out_type must be 'dipole','2_tensor' respectively.

    device: device type, either torch.device('cuda') represents gpu or torch.device('cpu')  represents cpu
